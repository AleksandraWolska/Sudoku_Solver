# Sudoku_Solver
Mini Sudoku Solver project using API and minimal backend

Sudoku solver connects to the API found on the RapidApi website. The project has a minimal backend, thanks to which I can hide the RapidApi access key. The backend is started with the command "npm run start:backend"

Used Express.js, Cors, Axios
